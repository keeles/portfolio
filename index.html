                I am a Full-Stack Web Developer located in Vancouver, BC. When I am not working on coding projects I
                spend my time skateboarding and cycling. Below are some of my recent projects.

                        <h3>Dumpster Fire</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Dumpster Fire is a message board web app, similar to reddit but heavily inspired by
                        slapmagazine.com</p>
                    <h3>Tech</h3>
                    <p>Dumpster Fire was built using ASP.NET Core version 8 and a MySQL database connected using the
                        code first approach with Entity Framework Core. The application was wrapped in a "Virtual Dom"
                        filter to turn the Model-View-Controller style routes into asynchronous XML requests to improve
                        the user experience by implementing single page application behavior.</p>
                    <p>Authentication and Authorization is handle by ASP.Net Identity Framework, with user and admin
                        roles. Third party OAuth is also enabled allowing users to register and sign-in with their
                        Google account</p>

                        <h3>Ziggaz Crochet</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>Ziggaz Crochet is a gallery / online store for a local Vancouver crochet creator that was looking
                        to showcase her products and handle commissions and sales outside of instagram and depop</p>
                    <h3>Tech</h3>
                    <p>Ziggaz Crochet was built using Sanity CMS to allow for easy content management by the
                        non-technical owner of the site. New products can be added through the Sanity Studio and
                        published to the app all through a clean UI. Commission forms that come through the site are
                        also shown in the Sanity Studio, allowing for easy organization for the store owner.</p>
                    <p>
                        The front-end of the store was built using React with Vite and Tanstack to ensure type safety
                        and handle the routing, form submission and error handling.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>ReachOut is a platform designed to bridge the gap between organizations helping formerly
                        incarcerated individuals and employers who are open to second-chance hiring. Many of these
                        individuals face barriers re-entering society, even though they often possess the skills,
                        motivation, and
                        dedication to succeed. At the same time, many employers are currently facing labor shortages
                        despite the valuable talent pool that is available. Our platform seeks to provide a solution to
                        both those problems.

                    <p>
                        I was acting as project manager and
                        full-stack developer through this project, in a team with 8 other BCIT students. 4 Designers
                        from the Digital Design and Development and 3 other developers from the Full-Stack Web
                        Development program.</p>
                    <h3>Tech</h3>
                    <p>Reach Out was built with Next.JS and a SQLite database. Using the Microsoft Azure AI API to
                        perform resume to job-listing matching based keyword and synonymous word matching to allow users
                        to find the most relevant jobs for them much more efficiently.</p>

                        <h3>Domino's Pizza App Redesign</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>A redesign of the Dominos Pizza app ordering system. This vertical is meant to improve on the app
                        only, so if viewing on desktop the page will not expand out further than 450 pixels.</p>
                    <h3>Tech</h3>
                    <p>The Dominos Canada mobile app has an outdated UI,
                        and very poor UX. The app brings users who want to
                        make a new order directly to their empty cart when
                        they click to create a new order, and then they must
                        navigate themselves back to the menu.</p>
                    <p>This being only a vertical of the app, I focused on the
                        interface of the menu and cart pages. Redesigning
                        them to be more modern, less cluttered with text and
                        with a more obvious calls to action to make
                        progressing through the menu much more intuitive.
